## Project Summary
This is a complete cross-platform CMake project for olcPixelGameEngine development. The project includes:

### Core Components
- **CMakeLists.txt**: Cross-platform build configuration with automatic platform detection
- **src/main.cpp**: Example application demonstrating olcPixelGameEngine features
- **src/olcPixelGameEngine.h**: Complete graphics engine header (277KB)
- **README.md**: Comprehensive documentation and build instructions
- **.vscode/tasks.json**: VS Code development tasks

### Platform Support
- **Windows**: WinAPI integration, MSVC/MinGW support
- **Linux**: X11 libraries, GCC/Clang support  
- **macOS**: GLUT framework support

### Development Workflow
1. Use VS Code Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
2. Run "Tasks: Run Build Task" to build
3. Use "Tasks: Run Task" â†’ "Run Application" to test
4. Modify `src/main.cpp` for your own applications

### Build Requirements
- CMake 3.16+
- C++17 compatible compiler
- OpenGL support
- Platform-specific libraries (automatically detected)

The project is fully functional and ready for olcPixelGameEngine development. The example application creates an animated graphics window demonstrating basic rendering capabilities.
	<!--
	README.md created with comprehensive build instructions for all platforms.
	CMakeLists.txt includes detailed comments and platform detection.
	VS Code tasks configured for easy development workflow.
	Project structure documented and example application provided.
